  "abstract": "NMFS announces that the Pacific Fishery Management Council (referred to as \"the Council\") has submitted amendment 35 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (PCGFMP) to the Secretary of Commerce for review. If approved, amendment 35 would define stocks that are in need of conservation and management, consistent with the provisions and guidelines of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). Amendment 35 would define stocks for eight species within the fishery management unit. These species were prioritized because they are scheduled for stock assessments in 2025 or in 2027. Amendment 35 is necessary for NMFS to make stock status determinations, which in turn will help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, and achieve optimum yield. Amendment 35 is administrative in nature and does not change harvest levels or timing and location of fishing, nor does it revise the goals and objectives or the management frameworks of the PCGFMP.",
