  "title": "Safety Standard for Stationary Activity Centers",
  "abstract": "In June 2019, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) published a consumer product safety standard for stationary activity centers pursuant to section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The Commission's mandatory standard incorporates by reference ASTM F2012-18[egr]\\1\\, Standard Consumer Safety Performance Specification for Stationary Activity Centers. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. In November 2024, ASTM published a revised voluntary standard. This direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for stationary activity centers to incorporate by reference the 2024 version of ASTM F2012, which the Commission has allowed to become the mandatory standard under section 104. The purpose of the direct final rule is to conform the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to the correct version of ASTM F2012 to provide an accurate reference to the standard that will be enforced as a mandatory rule.",
