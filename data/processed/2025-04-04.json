First, the EPA is determining that the Washington Area attained the 2015 ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of August 3, 2024. Second, the EPA is determining that the Washington Area has clean data under the EPA's Clean Data Policy. Lastly, the EPA is taking final action on an exceptional events request submitted by the District of Columbia (DC) on March 20, 2024, and concurred on by the EPA on July 17, 2024. This action addresses the EPA's obligation under Clean Air Act (CAA) sections 179(c) and 181(b)(2) to determine whether the Washington Area attained the 2015 ozone NAAQS by the August 3, 2024 attainment date and, as set forth in the EPA's Clean Data Policy, will suspend the obligation of DC, the State of Maryland (MD), and the Commonwealth of Virginia (VA) to submit certain attainment planning requirements for as long as the Washington Area continues to attain the 2015 ozone NAAQS. This action is being taken under the CAA.",
