  "abstract": "This document amends the Table of TV Allotments (table) of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules by substituting channel *29 for channel *13 at Monroe, Louisiana in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by Louisiana Educational Television Authority (LETA), the licensee of noncommercial educational television PBS member station KLTM-TV, channel *13, Monroe, Louisiana. The staff engineering analysis finds that the proposal is in compliance with the Commission's principal community coverage and technical requirements. The substitution of channel *29 for channel *13 in the table will not result in any loss of existing service and it will also allow LETA to remedy its known viewer reception issues on its currently authorized VHF channel.",
