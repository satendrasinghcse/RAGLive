  "abstract": "We are advising the public that we have prepared a pest risk analysis that evaluates the risks associated with the importation of fresh leaves and stems of glasswort (Salicornia europaea L.) for consumption from Israel into the United States. Based on the analysis, we have determined that the application of one or more designated phytosanitary measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks of introducing or disseminating plant pests or noxious weeds via the importation of fresh leaves and stems of glasswort from Israel into the United States. We are making the pest risk analysis available to the public for review and comment.",
