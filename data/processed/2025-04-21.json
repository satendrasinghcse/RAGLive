  "abstract": "All 10 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regions are proposing for public comment the 2026 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit for stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, also referred to as the \"2026 Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP)\" or the \"proposed permit.\" EPA is extending the comment period for 45 days, from April 4, 2025, to May 19, 2025, in response to stakeholder requests for an extension. The proposed permit, once finalized, will replace the EPA's existing MSGP that expires on February 28, 2026. The EPA proposes to issue this permit for five (5) years. Once finalized, this permit will be available in areas where the EPA is the NPDES permitting authority. The EPA solicits comment on all aspects of the proposed general permit and seeks public comment on specific requests for information as described in this document. The public is encouraged to read the proposed permit fact sheet to better understand the proposed permit requirements. The proposed permit and fact sheet can be found at https://www.epa.gov/ npdes/stormwater-discharges-industrial-activities.",
