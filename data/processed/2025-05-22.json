The regulations subpart D are obsolete and unnecessary because The Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 eliminated mandatory grading of types of tobacco eligible for price support programs and a referendum of eligible producers voted in favor of terminating the designations for tobacco auction markets in June of 2005.",
