In the September 16, 2024, notice, EPA indicated that it would issue a final cancellation order implementing the request, unless the Agency received substantive comments within the comment period that would merit further review of these requests, or the registrant withdrew its request. The Agency received two comments on the notice, which are summarized in Unit III.B. Gharda did not withdraw the request for this amendment. Accordingly, EPA hereby grants the requested amendment to terminate asparagus as shown in this cancellation order.
