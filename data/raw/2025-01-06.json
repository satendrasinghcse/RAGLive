This notice is being issued prior to passage of a FY 2025 Appropriations Act in order to allow applicants sufficient time to leverage financing, prepare and submit their applications, and give the Agency time to process applications within FY 2025. Based on FY 2024 appropriated funding, the Agency estimates that approximately $40 million will be available for FY 2025. Successful applications will be selected by the Agency for funding and subsequently awarded to the extent that funding may ultimately be made available through appropriations. All applicants are responsible for any expenses incurred in developing their applications.",

This proposed AD would require an inspection of the engine-driven pump pressure hoses for any damage and minimum clearance between the engine-driven pump hydraulic pressure hose and case drain, suction pressure hose, and surrounding pylon structure; and corrective actions if necessary.
