These recommendations are being proposed based in part on concerns that the accuracy of pulse oximeters can be affected by, among other factors, a person's skin pigmentation. The recommendations are being proposed to inform the performance evaluation for these devices, to support premarket submissions, regardless of submission type, and to promote consistency and facilitate efficient review of these submissions. Among other topics, the draft guidance also proposes recommendations for labeling, which are intended to promote the safe and effective use of pulse oximeters and help users understand the benefits and risks associated with the use of the device. This draft guidance is not final nor is it for implementation at this time.",

The guidance also recommends additional steps that HCT/P establishments should take to reduce risk of transmission of Mtb until such time as appropriate FDA-licensed, approved, or cleared donor screening tests are available for use to test donors for Mtb infection. The guidance identifies Mtb as a relevant communicable disease agent or disease (RCDAD) and supplements the recommendations contained in other donor eligibility guidance documents for donors of HCT/Ps. This guidance is being issued to address the urgent public health need to reduce the risk of transmission of Mtb by HCT/Ps.",

      "title": "Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Removal of Ute Ladies'-Tresses From the List of Endangered and Threatened Plants",
      "type": "Proposed Rule",
      "abstract": "We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), propose to remove Ute ladies'-tresses (Spiranthes diluvialis) from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Plants. This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to delist Ute ladies'- tresses. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that delisting the species is warranted. Our review indicates that the threats to Ute ladies'-tresses have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Accordingly, we propose to delist Ute ladies'-tresses. If we finalize this rule as proposed, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 7 and 9, would no longer apply to Ute ladies'-tresses. We request information and comments from the public regarding this proposed rule and the draft post-delisting monitoring (PDM) plan for Ute ladies'-tresses.",

Specifically, DOE is incorporating by reference the latest version of the relevant industry consensus test standard, AHRI 210/240-2024 (I-P) for the current test procedure for CAC/HPs (\"appendix M1\") for measuring the current cooling and heating metrics--seasonal energy efficiency ratio 2 (\"SEER2\") and heating seasonal performance factor 2 (\"HSPF2\"). DOE is incorporating by reference the new industry consensus test standard, AHRI 1600-2024 (I-P), for a new test procedure (\"appendix M2\") for CAC/HPs that adopts two new metrics--seasonal cooling and off-mode rating efficiency (\"SCORE\") and seasonal heating and off-mode rating efficiency (\"SHORE\"). Testing to the SCORE and SHORE metrics would not be required until such time as compliance is required with any amended energy conservation standard based on the new metrics. Additionally, DOE is amending certain provisions of DOE's regulations related to representations and enforcement for CAC/HPs.",
