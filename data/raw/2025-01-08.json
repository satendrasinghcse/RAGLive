Leaders from public health, laboratory, medical, academic, and industry sectors will have the opportunity to provide individual input, without building a consensus, on accelerating the diagnosis of current hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Members of the public with interest and expertise in diagnosing HCV infection are also invited to provide individual input. Specifically, the convening will focus on how to leverage the following hepatitis C diagnostic methods: same-day diagnosis and treatment, and viral-first testing. The goal of the convening will be for each person to give their individual input, and not to build consensus. No discussions, recommendations, or advice to CDC will occur or be provided at the meeting. Day 1 will focus on the utility of point-of- care (POC) testing for accelerating same-day HCV diagnosis and rapid treatment i.nitiation. Day 2 will focus on the utility of viral-first testing strategies for accelerating HCV diagnosis and treatment initiation in the United States. Following the meeting, APHL will prepare a meeting report summarizing the discussion and public comment received through regulations.gov, developed and documented as individual input to ensure thorough and complete input from partners. CDC and APHL will disseminate the APHL-prepared report as a reference for partners and industry to follow in developing and implementing future hepatitis C testing strategies. The final report will be added to docket CDC-2025-0002 once it is available.",

This action is mandated by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended through the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (\"the 2015 Act\"). The 2015 Act prescribes a formula for annually adjusting the statutory maximum and minimum amount of civil monetary penalties to reflect inflation, maintain the deterrent effect of statutory civil monetary penalties, and promote compliance with the law. The rule does not establish specific civil monetary penalty amounts the EPA may seek in particular cases. The EPA calculates those amounts, as appropriate, based on the facts of particular cases and applicable agency penalty policies. The EPA's civil penalty policies, which guide enforcement personnel on how to exercise the EPA's discretion within statutory penalty authorities, take into account a number of fact-specific considerations, e.g., the seriousness of the violation, the violator's good faith efforts to comply, any economic benefit gained by the violator as a result of its noncompliance, and the violator's ability to pay.",

Specifically, this document adopts service rules under new rule part 88 that provide operators the ability to obtain direct frequency assignments in a portion of the 5030-5091 MHz band for non-networked operation. Under these rules, one or more dynamic frequency management systems (DFMSs) will manage and coordinate access to the spectrum and enable its safe and efficient use, by providing requesting operators with temporary frequency assignments to support UAS control link communications with a level of reliability suitable for operations in controlled airspace and other safety-critical circumstances. To address concerns regarding the impact of these aeronautical operations on adjacent services, this document locates these operations, for now, in the central part of the band, with substantial separation from the bands adjacent to the 5030- 5091 MHz band.",

This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the bleached sandhill skipper. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the subspecies is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list the bleached sandhill skipper as an endangered species under the Act. If we finalize this rule as proposed, the final rule would add this subspecies to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to the subspecies. We find that a designation of critical habitat for the bleached sandhill skipper is not determinable at this time.",
