This corridor runs through the southwestern portion of the San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge and the adjacent Bayside neighborhood of the City of Imperial Beach. The purpose of the coastal resilience corridor is to improve flood protection for the adjacent community, which is vulnerable to coastal flooding, by converting the existing circulation corridor into a nature-based coastal flood resilience system; provide safe land-based public access along San Diego Bay; and strengthen ecosystem resilience by providing transitional habitat areas along the San Diego Bay's edge. The unique identification number for this project is 2025-0003688-NEPA- 001. The Service is providing this notice to open a public scoping period in accordance with the requirements of NEPA and its implementing regulations.

TTB had also proposed to generally eliminate the standards of fill for wine and distilled spirits, as an alternative to approving specific new standards of fill. Upon careful consideration of comments received, however, TTB is not adopting that proposal at this time. The amendments described in this final rule respond to industry member requests for additional flexibility to use a wider range of container sizes and are expected to facilitate the movement of goods in domestic and international commerce while also providing consumers broader purchasing options.",

The final rule specifies that it is an unfair and deceptive practice for businesses to offer, display, or advertise any price of live-event tickets or short-term lodging without clearly, conspicuously and prominently disclosing the total price. The rule also requires businesses to clearly and conspicuously make certain disclosures before a consumer consents to pay. The rule further specifies that it is an unfair and deceptive practice for businesses to misrepresent any fee or charge in any offer, display, or advertisement for live-event tickets or short-term lodging.",

      "abstract": "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is affirming as final the 2016 interim rule that added all species of salamanders from 20 genera to the list of injurious amphibians. Under the injurious wildlife prohibitions of the Lacey Act, this final rule prohibits the importation into the United States and shipment between the continental United States, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States of any live or dead specimen, including hybrids and parts, of those 20 genera of salamanders, except by permit for certain purposes or by Federal agencies solely for their own use. In addition to finalizing the listing of those 20 genera, we are publishing a new interim rule to add to the injurious amphibian list 16 genera that recent studies determined are also carriers of the fungus and to clarify some provisions from the final rule. This interim rule includes any live or dead specimen, hybrid, or parts of the 16 genera and opens a public comment period. We take these actions to protect U.S. ecosystems from the introduction, establishment, and spread of the lethal chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, which infects and is carried by salamanders, and which is not yet known to be found in the United States.",
