The VFC Program is designed to encourage correction of fiduciary breaches and compliance with the law by permitting persons to avoid potential Department of Labor civil enforcement actions and civil penalties if they voluntarily correct eligible transactions in a manner that meets the requirements of the Program. PTE 2002-51 is a related class exemption that allows excise tax relief from excise taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for certain eligible transactions corrected pursuant to the VFC Program. This amendment to PTE 2002-51 is being finalized in connection with the Department's amendment and restatement of the VFC Program, published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register (2025 VFC Program). These amendments simplify and expand the VFC Program and exemptive relief to make the Program and exemption easier to use and more useful for employers and others who wish to avail themselves of the relief provided. The amendment to PTE 2002-51 affects plans, participants and beneficiaries of such plans, and certain other persons engaging in such transactions.",

The purpose of risk evaluations under TSCA is to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under the conditions of use, including unreasonable risk to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations identified as relevant to the risk evaluation by EPA, and without consideration of costs or non-risk factors. EPA used the best available science to prepare this final risk evaluation and determined, based on the weight of scientific evidence, that DINP poses unreasonable risk to human health. Under TSCA, EPA must initiate risk management actions to address the unreasonable risk.",

This draft risk assessment reflects the agency's latest scientific understanding of the potential risks to human health and the environment posed by the presence of PFOA and PFOS in sewage sludge that is land applied as a soil conditioner or fertilizer (on agricultural, forested, and other lands), surface disposed, or incinerated. The draft risk assessment focuses on those living on or near impacted sites or those that rely primarily on their products (e.g., food crops, animal products, drinking water); the draft risk assessment does not model risks for the general public. This draft risk assessment underwent independent external peer review, and the EPA revised the document accordingly. Once finalized, the risk assessment will provide information on risk from use or disposal of sewage sludge and will inform the EPA's potential future regulatory actions under the Clean Water Act (CWA).",

      "type": "Notice",
      "abstract": "The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), as amended in 1996, requires that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determine whether to regulate at least five unregulated contaminants every five years. The decision to regulate or not to regulate a contaminant is known as a regulatory determination. In most cases, the contaminants chosen for regulatory determination are selected from the most recent Contaminant Candidate List (CCL), which the SDWA requires the EPA to publish every five years. This document presents the preliminary regulatory determinations and supporting rationale for contaminants listed on the EPA's fifth CCL (CCL 5). Since the fourth round of regulatory determinations was published in March 2021, the EPA has made determinations to regulate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), including individual determinations for three PFAS: perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid and its ammonium salt (HFPO-DA, also known as GenX or GenX chemicals); and mixtures including two or more of these three PFAS and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). In April 2024, the agency issued a final National Primary Drinking Water Regulation that includes these four PFAS as well as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). In this Federal Register Notice (FRN), the EPA is making preliminary determinations not to regulate nine additional contaminants from CCL 5: 2-aminotoluene, cylindrospermopsin, ethoprop, microcystins, molybdenum, permethrin, profenofos, tebuconazole and tribufos. The EPA requests public comment on these preliminary determinations and other aspects of this FRN. The EPA also presents updates on additional contaminants from CCL 5, as well as on some of those that have been considered in previous rounds of regulatory determinations and for which the EPA has not yet made a regulatory determination. The agency is also presenting and requesting comment on the process and analyses used for this round of regulatory determinations (i.e., RD 5), the supporting information, and the rationale used to make these preliminary decisions.",

Changing the eligibility restrictions that went into effect on July 1, 2024, to July 1, 2027, allows the Department to meet its statutory obligations while it undertakes the necessary administrative changes to make its repayment plans compliant with the terms of an injunction pending appeal from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (Eighth Circuit).",

Second, this action proposes discrete technical changes to the vent gas net heating value (NHV) continuous monitoring requirements and alternative performance test (sampling demonstration) option for flares and enclosed combustion devices. In a letter dated May 6, 2024, the EPA notified petitioners and the public that the Agency granted reconsideration on these two aspects of the March 8, 2024 (89 FR 16820) final rule. These amendments neither propose changes to any other aspect of the final rule, nor propose to alter the substance of any emission standards within the final rule.

The VFC Program is designed to encourage correction of fiduciary breaches and compliance with the law by permitting persons to avoid potential Department of Labor civil enforcement actions and civil penalties if they voluntarily correct eligible transactions in a manner that meets the requirements of the Program. The amendments to the Program simplify and expand the VFC Program to make the Program easier to use and more useful for employers and others who wish to avail themselves of the relief provided. Specifically, the Program amendments add a self-correction feature for delinquent transmittal of participant contributions and loan repayments to a pension plan under certain circumstances; clarify some existing transactions eligible for correction under the Program; expand the scope of other transactions currently eligible for correction; and simplify certain administrative or procedural requirements for participation in and correction of transactions under the VFC Program. In addition, the amendments implement section 305(b)(2) and (3) of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 (SECURE 2.0 Act) by adding a self-correction feature for certain participant loan failures self-corrected under the Internal Revenue Service's Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (as described in Rev.

      "type": "Proposed Rule",
      "abstract": "We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or FWS), propose to revise the listing of the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) in the lower-48 States under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act or ESA). After a review of the best scientific and commercial data available, we affirm that the currently listed grizzly bear population meets our requirements for consideration as a distinct population segment (DPS) under the Act and that the population remains likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future. However, we find that clarification of the geographic areas included within the DPS is warranted. Therefore, we propose to revise the listing by defining the boundaries of the contiguous U.S. grizzly bear DPS. The revised entity would include all geographic portions of the currently listed lower-48 entity that contain suitable habitat and where grizzly bears are currently found or are likely to be found in the future as populations recover. This area includes all of Washington and portions of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. The contiguous U.S. grizzly bear DPS would retain threatened species status. This proposed rule would promote conservation of the grizzly bear by ensuring that the listing under the Act explicitly reflects the areas where grizzly bears currently occur and are likely to occur in the future. Clarifying that the listing does not include areas outside of the grizzly bear's historical range will assist as recovery proceeds. We are also proposing to revise protective regulations for the grizzly bear issued under section 4(d) of the Act.",

In conjunction with the expansion of these controls, which BIS has determined are necessary to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, BIS is adding new license exceptions and updating the Data Center Validated End User authorization to facilitate the export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) of advanced computing (ICs) to end users in destinations that do not raise national security or foreign policy concerns. Together, these changes will cultivate secure ecosystems for the responsible diffusion and use of AI and advanced computing ICs.",
