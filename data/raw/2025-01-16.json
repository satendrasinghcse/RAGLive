This Federal Register notice seeks public comment on one or more of our collection of information requests that we believe are generic and fall within the scope of the umbrella. Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding our burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information, including: the necessity and utility of the proposed information collection for the proper performance of the agency's functions, the accuracy of the estimated burden, ways to enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information to be collected, and the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology to minimize the information collection burden.",

This exemption will permit the six drivers to test-drive Daimler vehicles on U.S. roads to better understand product requirements in \"real-world\" environments and verify results. FMCSA reviewed the drivers' commercial license records provided by Daimler and believes the requirements for a German commercial license, the work restrictions imposed on Daimler drivers by their nonimmigrant visas, and the terms and conditions set forth below, will ensure that Daimler's operation under this exemption will likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level that would be achieved in the absence of the exemption.",

The exemption covers individuals who successfully complete a training program that is self- certified by the training provider as consistent with a set of recommended practices (RPs) developed by the ATA's Technology and Maintenance Council (TMC) and motor carriers and IEPs who rely on these training programs and individuals to satisfy FMCSA's rules. The Agency has determined that granting the exemption from the requirements for 1 year of training, experience, or a combination thereof for individuals who successfully complete, and educators who provide, a performance- based inspector training program consistent with the TMC RPs, would likely achieve a level of safety equivalent to or greater than the level of safety provided by the regulatory requirements.",

The Draft RP/EA #3 proposes alternatives to help restore wetlands, coastal, and nearshore habitats impacted by the DWH oil spill. The Draft RP/EA #3 evaluates eight restoration alternatives under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), including criteria set forth in the OPA Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) regulations and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its implementing regulations. A No Action Alternative is also evaluated pursuant to the NEPA. The total estimated cost to implement the Texas TIG's seven preferred alternatives is approximately $40 million.

The clarifications also specify that non-integrated lamps be tested with a fluorescent lamp ballast, high intensity discharge (\"HID\") lamp ballast or external light-emitting diode (\"LED\") driver selected based on compatibility lists and availability; and provide specifications regarding the starting method, ballast factor, and number of lamps. This rulemaking is limited in scope and is providing clarifications to the current test procedures that are required for certification of compliance with existing applicable GSL energy conservation standards. Further, this rulemaking does not satisfy the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (\"EPCA\") requirement that, at least once every 7 years, DOE review the test procedures for GSLs.",

After publication, the EPA became aware of an error in the preamble text regarding the date for State, local, and Tribal monitoring agencies to complete implementation of the new ozone cross-section value, as well as a lack of clarity as to which entities the 2025 and 2026 implementation dates apply. With this action, the EPA is updating the final rule preamble and regulatory text to clarify the applicable implementation dates and the specific entities to which they apply. These corrections do not include any substantive changes to the final rule.",
