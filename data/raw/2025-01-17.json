Specifically, the rule establishes guidelines for the reporting and verification of practices and technologies used in the production of certain commodity crops that result in lower greenhouse gas emissions or increases in carbon storage. These practices are referred to in the context of this rule as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices. The guidelines established through this rule articulate an approach for farm producers to quantify the GHG emissions associated with crops produced using one or more CSA practices. The guidelines also articulate a framework for how information regarding GHG emissions, resulting from the production of biofuel feedstock commodity crops, could be reported and tracked throughout the supply chain.",

These fires are defined as having a maximum pile size of three feet in diameter by two feet high using seasoned firewood or charcoal, generally associated with backyard, summer campfires. Ecology and ORCAA provided a review of the historical record to demonstrate that the ban on recreational fires was not relied upon for attainment, maintenance, or reasonable further progress in the Thurston County area. Ecology and ORCAA also provided data to demonstrate that removing the ban on recreational fires would not interfere with maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards. Therefore, we are approving the request by Ecology and ORCAA to remove this provision from the SIP.",

This notice of availability (NOA) announces the start of the public review and comment period, as well as the dates and times for public meetings on the DEIS. After DOE LPO holds the public meetings and addresses public comments submitted during the review period, DOE LPO will publish a final environmental impact statement.
