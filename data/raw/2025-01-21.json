This action is in response to a February 10, 2023, decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Sixth Circuit or Court) to remand without vacatur EPA's removal of the ANR from the Ohio SIP. Because the Court did not vacate EPA's removal of the ANR, the ANR is currently not in Ohio's SIP. After reevaluating EPA's November 19, 2020, rulemaking, upon remand, EPA proposed to determine that its November 2020 final action was in error, and to correct that action by reinstating the ANR as part of the Ohio SIP. EPA proposed to take this action on February 22, 2024 and received both supportive and adverse comments. EPA is finalizing this action as proposed, and upon the effective date of this action, the ANR will be reinstated into the Ohio SIP.",

It also codifies, in the Commission's outage reporting rules, that a subject provider's Networks Outage Reporting System reporting obligations are waived while they report in DIRS and requires that subject providers who report in DIRS provide a single, final DIRS report to the Commission, within 24 hours of the Commission's deactivation of DIRS, that provides the status of their infrastructure identified to the Commission during the DIRS reporting period that has not yet been fully restored at the time of the deactivation.

This action will update the California SIP with rules that the District has revised to address deficiencies identified in a previous limited disapproval action and to incorporate other revisions related to NSR requirements. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action. Elsewhere in this Federal Register, we are making an interim final determination that will defer the imposition of CAA sanctions associated with our previous limited disapproval action.

      "abstract": "In accordance with our regulations, NHTSA is granting a petition from Legacy Limousines and Luxury Coaches for a temporary exemption from the requirement to install Type 2 seat belts (i.e., shoulder belts) at side-facing locations in the company's motorcoaches. The petitioner is a final-stage manufacturer of entertainer-type motorcoaches, seeking temporary exemption from the shoulder belt requirement of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208, \"Occupant crash protection,\" for side-facing seats on motorcoaches. The granted exemption permits the petitioner to install Type 1 seat belts (lap belt only) at side-facing seating positions, instead of the Type 2 seat belts (lap and shoulder belts) required by FMVSS No. 208. After reviewing the petition and the comments received, the agency has determined that the requested exemption is warranted to enable the petitioner to sell a vehicle whose overall level of safety or impact protection is at least equal to that of a nonexempted vehicle.",

Based on our review, we find that the petitions to list the Amargosa toad (Anaxyrus nelsoni), Carson Valley monkeyflower (Erythranthe carsonensis), large marble butterfly (Euchloe ausonides) (including the large marble butterfly type subspecies (Euchloe ausonides ausonides)), Mohave ground squirrel (Xerospermophilus mohavensis), Morrison bumble bee (Bombus morrisoni), Oasis Valley population of Amargosa speckled dace (Rhinichthys nevadensis nevadensis; hereafter referred to as \"Oasis Valley speckled dace\"), Tennessee bottlebrush crayfish (Barbicambarus simmonsi), and one petition to delist the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned actions may be warranted. Therefore, with the publication of this document, we announce that we are initiating status reviews of these species to determine whether the petitioned actions are warranted. To ensure that the status reviews are comprehensive, we request scientific and commercial data and other information regarding the species and factors that may affect their status. Based on the status reviews, we will issue 12-month petition findings, which will address whether or not the petitioned actions are warranted, in accordance with the Act.",

In this rule, the EPA proposes to add new EPA methods for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, and add methods previously published by voluntary consensus bodies that industries and municipalities would use for reporting under the EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program. The EPA also proposes to withdraw the seven Aroclor (PCB mixtures) parameters. In addition, the EPA is proposing to simplify the sampling requirements for two volatile organic compounds, and make a series of minor corrections to existing tables of approved methods.
