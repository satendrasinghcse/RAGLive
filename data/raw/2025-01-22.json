The project has been delayed and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has been conducted. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA.

The SEIS is necessary to evaluate modification of a component of Alternative 4A that would install a buried pipeline irrigation across lands that were not evaluated in FEIS. Installation of this pipeline would require blasting which was not addressed in FEIS. The intended effect of this action would result in the most economically viable way of providing surface water irrigation to specific cultivated lands in the Study Area in lieu of groundwater irrigation. The SEIS will examine an irrigation delivery system designated East Low Canal (EL) 11.8 that would serve approximately 7,638 acres of land currently served by groundwater in the northeastern portion of the East Columbia Basin Irrigation District (ECBID) in Grant County. NRCS is accepting comments regarding significant issues, potential alternatives, information, and analyses relevant to the proposed action from all interested individuals, Federal and State agencies, and Tribes.",

The Commission is also revising asset-based and issuer-based concentration limits for the investment of customer funds. The Commission is also specifying market risk capital charges that a futures commission merchant must take on new investments added to the list of permitted investments in computing the firm's adjusted net capital. The amendments also revise regulations that require each futures commission merchant to report to the Commission, and to the firm's designated self-regulatory organization, the name, location, and amount of customer funds held by each depository, including any investments of customer funds held by the depository. Lastly, the Commission is eliminating the requirement that each depository holding customer funds must provide the Commission with read-only electronic access to such accounts for the futures commission merchant to treat the funds as customer segregated funds.",

      "type": "Proposed Rule",
      "abstract": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to establish a new area source category to address chemical manufacturing process units (CMPUs) using ethylene oxide (EtO). The EPA is proposing to list EtO in table 1 to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Chemical Manufacturing Area Sources (referred to as the CMAS NESHAP in this document) and to add EtO- specific requirements to the CMAS NESHAP. The EPA is also proposing to add a fenceline monitoring program for EtO. In addition, the EPA is proposing new requirements for pressure vessels and pressure relief devices (PRDs). This proposal also presents the results of the EPA's technology review of the CMAS NESHAP as required under the Clean Air Act (CAA). As part of this technology review, the EPA is proposing to add new leak detection and repair (LDAR) requirements to the CMAS NESHAP for equipment leaks in organic HAP service and heat exchange systems. The EPA is also proposing performance testing once every 5 years and to add provisions for electronic reporting. We estimate that the proposed amendments to the CMAS NESHAP, excluding the proposed EtO emission standards, would reduce hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from emission sources by approximately 158 tons per year (tpy). Additionally, the proposed EtO emission standards are expected to reduce EtO emissions by approximately 4.6 tpy.",
