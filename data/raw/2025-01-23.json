Summer Nuclear Station, Unit 1 (V.C. Summer). The public comment period closed on January 21, 2025. The NRC has rescheduled the in-person public meeting to receive comments on the document and is therefore reopening the public comment period to allow more time for members of the public to submit their comments.",

This proposed AD was prompted by a widespread fatigue damage (WFD) scenario review for a certification project that indicated several cracks found around the potable water and wastewater service panels were WFD instead of typical fatigue. This proposed AD would require modification of the potable water and wastewater service panels, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR).
