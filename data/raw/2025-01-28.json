Other applications of the NWPL include wetland restoration, establishment, and enhancement projects. To update the NWPL, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), as part of an interagency effort with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), is announcing the availability of the draft changes to the 2024 NWPL to solicit public comments. The public will now have the opportunity to comment on the proposed changes to wetland indicator status ratings for ten plant species over five different regions.",

This collection involves two distinct methods of collecting. The first method of collecting uses the traditional paper/ hardcopy forms which is limited in scope. The second method is more expansive and uses online web-based forms or Application Programming Interface (API) upload functionality. The information can then be shared with a potential employer to aid them in their hiring decision- making process. The information collected can be release to a hiring employer by the pilot. Disclosure of their information is not possible unless the pilot first authorizes the release. The information to be collected will be used to and/or is necessary because before allowing an individual to begin service as a pilot, and air carrier or operator shall receive and evaluate all relevant information pertaining to the individual. On November 21, 2024, the FAA published the final rule Integration of Powered-Lift: Pilot Certification and Operations; Miscellaneous Amendments Related to Rotorcraft and Airplanes (89 FR 92296). That rulemaking action will result in four additional operators and 171 additional pilots subject to the requirements of the Pilot Records Database. In the final rule, the FAA neglected to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on that increased burden. The FAA is publishing this notice to remedy that oversight.",
