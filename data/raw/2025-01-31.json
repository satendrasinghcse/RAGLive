      "abstract": "In December 2010, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) published a consumer product safety standard for non-full-size baby cribs (NFS cribs) pursuant to section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The Commission's mandatory standard incorporates by reference ASTM F406, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Non-Full-Size Baby Cribs/ Play Yards, with modifications that exclude sections of ASTM F406 that apply to play yards exclusively. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. On August 1, 2024, ASTM approved a revised voluntary standard, and this direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for NFS cribs to incorporate by reference the 2024 version of ASTM F406.",

This AD requires checking the operation of the shear- button safety-cap on each applicable collective pitch handle and prohibits installing certain part-numbered collective pitch handles or collective sticks with those part-numbered collective pitch handles installed unless certain requirements are met.

      "abstract": "The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain General Electric Company (GE) Model GEnx-1B64, GEnx-1B64/ P1, GEnx-1B64/P2, GEnx-1B67, GEnx-1B67/P1, GEnx-1B67/P2, GEnx-1B70, GEnx-1B70/75/P1, GEnx-1B70/75/P2, GEnx-1B70/P1, GEnx-1B70/P2, GEnx- 1B70C/P1, GEnx-1B70C/P2, GEnx-1B74/75/P1, GEnx-1B74/75/P2, GEnx-1B76/ P2, GEnx-1B76A/P2, and GEnx-2B67/P engines. This proposed AD was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that revealed certain high- pressure turbine (HPT) stage 1 and HPT stage 2 disks were manufactured from powder metal material suspected to contain iron inclusion. This proposed AD would require replacement of affected HPT stage 1 and HPT stage 2 disks with parts eligible for installation. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

This proposed AD was prompted by a report of cracking found in new locations at a certain body station (STA) during frame segment replacement repairs, including in the web at the K-hole between certain stringers, in the outer chord above the lower hinge intercostal, and in the inner chord and web between certain stringers. This proposed AD would require an inspection or records check for the presence of approved or local repairs, repetitive eddy current inspections for cracking, and applicable on-condition actions. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
