This AD was prompted by the determination that, in order to ensure the continued structural integrity of certain landing gear and associated components, it is necessary to require removal of these components from service prior to exceeding established fatigue lives. This AD requires determining the number of landings on affected main landing gears (MLGs), nose landing gears (NLGs), and associated components; removing from service any part that has reached or exceeded the established fatigue life and installing a replacement part; and prohibiting the installation of any affected part unless the number of landings for that part is below the established fatigue life. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

AD 2022-16-06 required modifying the trimmable horizontal stabilizer actuator (THSA) installation, implementing the electrical load sensing device (ELSD) wiring provisions, and installing and activating the ELSD. This AD was prompted by tests that demonstrated that when the upper secondary load path (SLP) of the THSA is engaged, the THSA might not stall, with consequently no indication of SLP engagement, and by the recent determination that the required actions of AD 2022-16-06 cannot be accomplished on certain airplanes. This AD continues to require the actions in AD 2022-16-06 with revised procedures, and also requires additional actions for certain airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

The NPRM was prompted by reports of a loss of water pressure during flight and water leaks that affected multiple pieces of electronic equipment, and by the discovery that some clamshell couplings did not have the required safety strap. The NPRM would have required inspecting all door 1 and door 3 lavatory and galley potable water systems for missing or incorrectly installed clamshell couplings, inspecting all clamshell couplings for the presence and correct installation of safety straps at door 1 and door 3 lavatories and galleys with a potable water system, and performing applicable on- condition actions. The NPRM would have also prohibited the installation of affected parts at inspection locations and removed Model 787-10 airplanes from the applicability. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has determined that the identified service information may not adequately address the unsafe condition on one of the galleys, and Model 787-10 airplanes should be included in the applicability.
