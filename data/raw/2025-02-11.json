      "abstract": "The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A321-111, -112, -131, -211, -212, -213, -231, -232, -251N, -252N, -253N, -271N, -272N, -251NX, -252NX, -253NX, - 271NX, and -272NX airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by the identification of an erroneous value of the main landing gear (MLG) tire width in the aircraft data files used for aircraft performance computation. This proposed AD would require revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to incorporate a complementary performance data file (CPDF) update as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

      "abstract": "The FAA is revising a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that applied to all airplanes with certain Pacific Scientific Company rotary buckle assemblies (buckles) installed. This action revises the NPRM by expanding the applicability and updating the referenced material. As an option to the actions proposed by this SNPRM, this SNPRM would allow removing the male side from the lap of the restraint system assembly and installing a placard stating that use of the seat is prohibited; use of that crewmember seat or passenger seat would then be prohibited until the actions proposed by this SNPRM are accomplished and the male side from the lap of the restraint system assembly is reinstalled. The NPRM was prompted by a report of a manufacturing defect in the screws used inside the buckle; this SNPRM is prompted by the discovery that additional screws are affected by the unsafe condition. The FAA is proposing this airworthiness directive (AD) to address the unsafe condition on these products. Since these actions would impose an additional burden over that in the NPRM, the FAA is requesting comments on this SNPRM.",
