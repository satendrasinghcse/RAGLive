      "abstract": "The FAA proposes to supersede Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2019-12-13, which applies to all The Boeing Company Model 757 airplanes. AD 2019-12-13 requires repetitive checks of the aileron trim actuator bearing for free rotation, repetitive detailed inspections of the aileron trim actuator attachment lug for damage and cracking, and applicable on-condition actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-12-13, the FAA has determined that a modification must be done to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2019-12-13. This proposed AD would also require for certain airplanes changing the lateral control box support assembly and installing an aileron trim actuator bracket, and for certain other airplanes replacing the existing actuator lateral control fitting with an aileron trim actuator bracket, which terminates the repetitive checks and inspections. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
