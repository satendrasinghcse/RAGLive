AD 2021-04- 18 also prohibited installing those M/R mast assemblies unless certain requirements were met. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-04-18, it was determined that additional M/R mast assemblies are affected by the same unsafe condition and that it is necessary to distinguish the affected part numbers between M/R mast assemblies and mast swashplate assemblies. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2021-04-18 and adds additional part-numbered M/R mast assemblies and distinguishes the affected part numbers between M/R mast assemblies and mast swashplate assemblies, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. This AD also clarifies the possible consequences that could result from the unsafe condition and clarifies a requirement. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
