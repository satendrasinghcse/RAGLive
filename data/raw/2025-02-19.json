The FM allotments are currently authorized licensed stations. FM assignments for authorized stations and reserved facilities will be reflected solely in Media Bureau's Licensing Management System (LMS). These FM allotment channels have previously undergone notice and comment rule making. This action constitutes an editorial change in the FM Table of Allotments.

The FM allotments were previously removed from the FM Table because a construction permit and/or license was granted. These FM allotments are now considered vacant because of the cancellation of the associated FM authorizations or the dismissal of long-form auction FM applications. A staff engineering analysis confirms that all of the vacant FM allotments complies with the minimum distance separation requirements and principle community coverage requirements of the Commission's rules. The window period for filing applications for these vacant FM allotments will not be opened at this time. Instead, the issue of opening these allotments for filing will be addressed by the Commission in subsequent order.",

In addition, the NRC is proposing amendments to implement a reduced hourly rate for advanced nuclear reactor applicants and pre-applicants for certain activities as required by the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act of 2024.",

This proposed AD was prompted by an investigation that showed a change in the feed-through connector O-ring material at a certain frame increased the electrical bonding resistance due to the current torque specification being inadequate. This proposed AD would require electrical bonding tests between the feed-through connectors and the forward side of the bulkhead at a certain frame, and the installation of two electrical bonding plates of connectors, as applicable, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR).
