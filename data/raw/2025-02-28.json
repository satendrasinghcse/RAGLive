The intended effect of the NJDEP's revisions to the SIP is to regulate the construction and modification of stationary sources with adequate requirements to ensure that the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are satisfied. The NJDEP's revisions will strengthen the SIP by updating the Federal air permitting program to conform with the State regulations that were in effect at the time of the SIP submission, which will ultimately better serve the regulated community and help to protect the quality of air in the State. The EPA proposed to approve this rule on December 17, 2024, and received no comments.",
