TVA's Preferred Alternative, Alternative B, involves the construction and operation of an approximately 500 megawatts (MW), dual fuel, simple cycle, frame combustion turbine (CT) facility on the NCG Plant property. Alternative B will achieve the purpose and need to support continued load growth within TVA's seven-state service territory in a way that is consistent with the recommendations in the 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). The CTs are needed to provide dispatchable generation capacity to ensure that TVA can reliably meet required year- round generation, maximum capacity system demands, planning reserve margin targets, and comply with a primary objective under the TVA Act that power be sold at rates as low as feasible. The addition of CT units to the fleet supports meeting the growing demand for electricity and enhances system flexibility to integrate distributed resources and renewables such as solar generation. As the amount of solar generation in the TVA generation portfolio continues to increase, flexibility of the remainder of the fleet becomes even more important.",

      "abstract": "The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain The Boeing Company Model 737-600, -700, -700C, -800, -900, and -900ER series airplanes. This AD was prompted by two engine fan blade- out (FBO) events that resulted in the separation of engine inlet cowl and fan cowl parts from the airplane damaging the fuselage, which caused loss of pressurization and subsequent emergency descent. The FBO events also resulted in cracks in the primary exhaust nozzle, potentially resulting in the departure of the primary exhaust nozzle and damaging a stabilizer or striking the fuselage and window. This AD requires an inspection or maintenance records check to determine if the primary exhaust nozzle has an affected part number and, for affected primary exhaust nozzles, an installation of bridge brackets onto the primary exhaust nozzle, or as an option, an installation of a serviceable primary exhaust nozzle. This AD also requires revising the existing maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, to incorporate new airworthiness limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
