      "type": "Proposed Rule",
      "abstract": "NMFS announces that the Pacific Fishery Management Council (referred to as \"the Council\") has submitted amendment 35 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (PCGFMP) to the Secretary of Commerce for review. If approved, amendment 35 would define stocks that are in need of conservation and management, consistent with the provisions and guidelines of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). Amendment 35 would define stocks for eight species within the fishery management unit. These species were prioritized because they are scheduled for stock assessments in 2025 or in 2027. Amendment 35 is necessary for NMFS to make stock status determinations, which in turn will help prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, and achieve optimum yield. Amendment 35 is administrative in nature and does not change harvest levels or timing and location of fishing, nor does it revise the goals and objectives or the management frameworks of the PCGFMP.",

Commerce is notifying the public that the CIT's final judgment is not in harmony with Commerce's final determination in that investigation, and that Commerce is amending the final determination from affirmative to negative as a result of the dumping margin assigned to PT. Zinus Global Indonesia (Zinus Indonesia) changing from 2.22 percent to 0.00 percent. Thus, Commerce is revoking the AD order on mattresses from Indonesia.",

These airplanes, as modified by Universal Avionics, will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is a digital systems architecture that will allow increased connectivity to and access from external network sources (e.g., operator networks, wireless devices, internet connectivity, service provider satellite communications, electronic flight bags, etc.) to the airplane's previously isolated electronic assets (networks, systems, and databases). The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.",

The proposed rule would implement the FCRA's definitions of consumer report and consumer reporting agency as well as certain of the FCRA's provisions governing when consumer reporting agencies may furnish, and users may obtain, consumer reports. The NPRM provided a comment period that was set to close on March 3, 2025. To allow interested persons more time to consider and submit their comments, the CFPB has determined that an extension of the comment period until April 2, 2025, is appropriate.",
