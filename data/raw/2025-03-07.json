DHS is seeking public input regarding important environmental issues that should be considered in the PEA. The PEA will be used to assess at a national scale the environmental impacts that may occur from the Proposed Action and establish standard Best Management Practices (BMPs) by which DHS can reduce such impacts. DHS invites federal agencies with jurisdiction by law and/or special expertise with respect to any potential environmental impact associated with the Proposed Action to formally cooperate with DHS in the preparation of the PEA.",

To meet this statutory mandate, the Commission builds upon its action in the September 2023 Second Report and Order which, among other things, reallocated the 2025-2110 MHz and 2200-2290 MHz bands for non-Federal Space Operation on a secondary basis and adopted, for these two bands, space launch licensing framework. Specifically, the Commission reallocates the 2360-2395 MHz band on a secondary basis for Space Operation. Next, the Commission incorporates the 2360-2395 MHz band into its existing part 26 space launch regulatory framework that includes, for example, space launch licensing and frequency coordination rules. In order to protect critical Federal and non- Federal flight testing operations, we incorporate into our certain technical rules from our current. Finally, the Commission confirms that the specific licensing, registration, frequency coordination, and frequency coordinator selection procedures, to be refined by the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau or WTB) on delegated authority, will apply to the LCA bands.",
