Since the FAA issued AD 2023-14-09, Airbus provided inspection instructions for a new inspection area of the upper and lower, front and rear spar corner fittings for certain airplanes. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2023-14-09 and would require a one-time detailed inspection (DET) for missing or incorrectly applied sealant of the front and rear spars for certain airplanes and applicable on-condition actions, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR).
