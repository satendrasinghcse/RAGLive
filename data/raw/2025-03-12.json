      "abstract": "The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Airbus SAS Model A300 B4-2C, A300 B4-203, A300 B4-603, A300 B4-605R, A300 B4-622, A300 B4-622R, and A300 F4-605R airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by reports of cracking of the main landing gear (MLG) support rib 5 lower flange on certain modified airplanes due to incorrect accomplishment of modification instructions. This proposed AD would require a special detailed inspection (geometrical inspection) of the MLG rib 5 lower flange holes on the left-hand wing and right- hand wing and repair if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

      "abstract": "The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2022-01- 02, which applied to certain De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited Model DHC-8-400, -401, and -402 airplanes. AD 2022-01-02 required inspecting for corrosion of the nacelle to wing rear spar attachment pins, and the nacelle to landing gear attachment pins, and doing all applicable corrective actions. This AD was prompted by a determination that some operators were unable to identify the airplanes subject to each requirement. This AD continues to require the actions specified in AD 2022-01-02, clarifies the affected airplanes for each required action, and revises the applicability by removing Model DHC-8-400 airplanes; as specified in Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
