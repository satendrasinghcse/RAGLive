United States, Endura Products, INC., Court No. 2023-1532 and Columbia Aluminum Products, LLC, v. United States, Endura Products, INC., Court No. 2023-1534 (collectively, Worldwide Federal Circuit), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) reversed the U.S. Court of International Trade's (CIT) Second Remand Order, and sustained the non-protested portions of Commerce's First Remand Redeterminations. The Federal Circuit also vacated the CIT's subsequent opinions and orders in this case following the Second Remand Order. In the First Remand Redeterminations, Commerce continued to find that certain door thresholds imported by Worldwide Door Components, Inc. (Worldwide) and Columbia Aluminum Products, Inc. (Columbia) are within the scope of the antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders on aluminum extrusions from the People's Republic of China (China). The CIT originally sustained Commerce's Third Remand Redeterminations finding the products in question outside the scope of the Orders under respectful protest, and on December 29, 2022, Commerce published a notice of court decisions not in harmony with its final scope ruling and notice of amended final scope ruling. However, consistent with the Federal Circuit's decision reversing and vacating the CIT's opinion and order, Commerce is now amending the final scope rulings, as they were represented in the Amended Final Scope Rulings, to find that the Worldwide and Columbia door thresholds at issue are subject to the Orders.",

This review seeks to develop forward-looking rules to better protect submarine cables, identify and mitigate harms affecting national security and law enforcement, and facilitate the deployment of submarine cables and capacity to the market. Among other things, the Commission proposes to adopt a three-year periodic reporting requirement for submarine cable landing licenses; in the alternative, the Commission seeks comment on shortening the current 25-year submarine cable license term or adopting a shorter license term in combination with periodic reporting. The Commission also proposes or seeks comment on codifying the Commission's legal jurisdiction and other legal requirements in its rules to provide regulatory certainty to submarine cable owners and operators. Additionally, the Commission proposes and seeks comment on appropriate applicant and application requirements to account for the evolution of technologies and facilities and changes in the national security landscape over the last two decades and to ensure the Commission has targeted and granular information regarding the ownership, control, use of a submarine cable system, and other things, which are critical to the Commission's review to assess potential national security risks and other important public interest factors. Further, the Commission seeks comment on improving the quality of the circuit capacity data and facilitating the sharing of such information with other Federal agencies. Through these proposals, the Commission seeks to ensure that the Commission is exercising appropriate oversight of submarine cables to safeguard U.S. communications networks.",
