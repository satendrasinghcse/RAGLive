      "abstract": "In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) proposes and seeks comment on changes to the rules that govern the operations of three distinct bands of spectrum, modernizing rules to facilitate opportunities for Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS). First, the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes and seeks comment on opening up the 450 MHz band to aeronautical command and control operations; allowing for a single, nationwide license in the band; and adopting flexible licensing, operating, and technical rules that will facilitate robust use of the band at a range of altitudes while minimizing interference to neighboring operations. It also proposes expanding radiolocation operations in the 24.45-24.65 GHz band for uncrewed aircraft system detection operations. Finally, the NPRM proposes to modernize the Commission's legacy power rules for Commercial Aviation Air-Ground Systems in the 849-851 and 894-896 MHz band, which is used for in-flight connectivity.",

In order to implement this proposed framework, the Commission seeks comment on whether the current 900 MHz broadband rules, such as the eligibility criteria, application requirements and procedures, licensing and operating rules, and technical requirements, are the appropriate vehicles for effectuating a ten megahertz broadband licensing framework. Additionally, pursuant to the Order, the Commission delegates to the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau of the Commission the authority to modify or terminate the current freeze on certain applications in the 900 MHz band.",

Amendment 55 would also establish status determination criteria (SDC), a rebuilding plan, catch levels, sector allocations, sector management measures, and accountability measures (AMs) for the new complex; and establish catch levels for the revised other SASWG complex. The purpose of Amendment 55 is to rebuild the scamp and yellowmouth grouper stock, and achieve optimum yield (OY) while minimizing, to the extent practicable, adverse social and economic effects.",

AD 2019-05-02 required repetitive inspections of the drains mast for any crack and replacement or repair of the drains mast if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2019-05-02, the manufacturer has developed a modification (improved drains mast and drains support bracket), which the FAA has determined mitigates the unsafe condition. This AD was prompted by cracks found in the transition duct area of the drains mast. This AD requires modification with improved drains mast and drains support bracket. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
