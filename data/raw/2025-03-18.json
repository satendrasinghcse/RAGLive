AD 2022-25-51 requires revising the Limitations section of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) to include a new warning and a new limitation. Since the FAA issued AD 2022-25-51, updated primary flight control computer (PFCC) software has been developed to address the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2022-25-51, require installing the updated PFCC software, which terminates the AFM revision, and remove airplanes from the applicability, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

AD 2020-03-14 requires an inspection of affected crew oxygen cylinder assemblies for any discrepancy and replacement of discrepant crew oxygen cylinder assemblies with serviceable parts, and allows installation of affected parts under certain conditions. Since the FAA issued AD 2020-03-14, the supplier introduced an improved oxygen cylinder assembly, that will ensure the correct function of the system. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2020-03-14 and would require replacement of all affected parts with redesigned parts and would also prohibit the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR).
