By decision served on January 14, 2025 (Decision No. 3), the Board approved Applicants' application. As a condition of its approval, the Board imposed a three-year oversight period, during which the Board will closely monitor Applicants' compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the conditions imposed by the Board. Throughout the oversight period, Applicants are required to report service, operational, and competition-related metrics at prescribed frequencies, as described in Decision No. 3. The Board now institutes this proceeding to implement the general oversight condition and provide further guidance regarding Applicants' reporting obligations. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------",

The proposed collection OMB 2133-0541 (United States Marine Highway Program) (the Program) will be used to evaluate and review applications being submitted for grant award consideration. The James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 made substantive changes to the Program, including eliminating the requirement for MARAD to designate projects before they are eligible to compete from grants. As a result, on August 28, 2023, MARAD discontinued this collection. The Maritime Administration intends to reinstate this collection to facilitate operation of the Program, which provides funding to develop, expand, or promote marine highway transportation or shipper use of marine highway transportation, this collection is being reinstated. We are required to publish this notice in the Federal Register to obtain comments from the public and affected agencies.",

This proposed AD was prompted by a determination that new or more restrictive airworthiness limitations are necessary. This proposed AD would require revising the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the existing maintenance manual (MM) or instructions for continued airworthiness (ICAs) and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
