We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action. Elsewhere in this Federal Register, we are making an interim final determination that will stay and defer the imposition of Clean Air Act (CAA or \"Act\") sanctions associated with a disapproval action related to the contingency measures requirement for this area.",

This AD was prompted by the determination that radio altimeters cannot be relied upon to perform their intended function if they experience interference from wireless broadband operations in the 3.7-3.98 GHz frequency band (5G C-Band). This AD requires installing a new radio frequency (RF) bandpass filter on the coaxial line between the radio altimeter and the receive antenna in the aft equipment compartment.
