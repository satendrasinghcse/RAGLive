This determination is based on a proposed approval, published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, of AVAQMD Rules 1301, 1302 (except 1302(C)(5) and 1302(C)(7)(c)), 1303, 1304, 1305, and 1309. The effect of this interim final determination is to stay the application of the offset sanction and to defer the action of the highway sanction that were triggered by the EPA's limited disapproval of AVAQMD Rules 1301, 1302 (except 1302(C)(5) and 1302(C)(7)(c)), 1303, 1304, 1305, 1309 on July 3, 2023.",

These helicopters, as modified by Carson Helicopters, Inc.

This design feature is an OLPD installed in the hoist. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These proposed special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.",

These revisions concern the District's New Source Review (NSR) permitting program for new and modified sources of air pollution under part D of title I of the Clean Air Act (CAA or \"Act\"). The submitted rules address deficiencies identified in a previous limited disapproval action and incorporate other revisions related to NSR requirements. If finalized, this action will update the AVAQMD's current SIP with the revised rules. We are taking comments on this proposal and plan to follow with a final action. Elsewhere in this Federal Register, we are making an interim final determination that will stay or defer the imposition of CAA sanctions associated with our previous limited disapproval action.",

However, the interim final rule exempts foreign reporting companies from having to report the BOI of any U.S. persons who are beneficial owners of the foreign reporting company and exempts U.S. persons from having to provide such information to any foreign reporting company for which they are a beneficial owner.

This action is necessary to facilitate the construction of the new replacement Portal Bridge North, as designed by Amtrak as the owner of the bridge, adjacent to the current Amtrak Portal Bridge. This final rulemaking limits the extent of the opening of the Amtrak Portal Bridge in the horizontal position to prevent the swing span from striking the new Portal Bridge North during construction.",
