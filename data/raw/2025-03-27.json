      "title": "Safety Standard for Stationary Activity Centers",
      "type": "Rule",
      "abstract": "In June 2019, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC or Commission) published a consumer product safety standard for stationary activity centers pursuant to section 104 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). The Commission's mandatory standard incorporates by reference ASTM F2012-18[egr]\\1\\, Standard Consumer Safety Performance Specification for Stationary Activity Centers. The CPSIA sets forth a process for updating mandatory standards for durable infant or toddler products that are based on a voluntary standard, when a voluntary standards organization revises the standard. In November 2024, ASTM published a revised voluntary standard. This direct final rule updates the mandatory standard for stationary activity centers to incorporate by reference the 2024 version of ASTM F2012, which the Commission has allowed to become the mandatory standard under section 104. The purpose of the direct final rule is to conform the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to the correct version of ASTM F2012 to provide an accurate reference to the standard that will be enforced as a mandatory rule.",

In order to facilitate testing of salmon excluders, this EFP would exempt participating vessels from complying with certain regulations, described below under Exemptions. Field testing would be conducted in July and August during the fishery's \"B' season. Effective dates of the EFP would be from June 30, 2025 to September 1, 2025. This experiment would test salmon excluder designs that aim to optimize salmon escapement and thus promote the objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act).",

      "abstract": "The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has decided to adopt the preferred alternative identified in the Sugar Camp Energy, LLC Mine No. 1 Significant Boundary Revision (SBR) Number (No.) 8 Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS; Document ID EISX-455-00-000- 1729685514). A Notice of Availability of the Final EIS was published in the Federal Register on January 17, 2025. The purpose and need of the proposed action is to comply with the terms and conditions of the previously executed leases and agreements regarding the TVA-owned mineral rights in Illinois which total approximately 64,689 acres (hereafter, TVA Mineral Rights Area). TVA's preferred alternative, analyzed in the EIS as Alternative B, consists of implementing the terms of the existing coal lease agreement, approving the plan to expand its underground longwall mining operations by approximately 22,414 acres (hereafter, SBR No. 8 Mine Area), and pursuing divestment of the TVA Mineral Rights Area from TVA's control and custody. This Record of Decision (ROD) describes TVA's decision to implement the terms of the existing coal lease agreement and approve the plan to mine TVA-owned coal in the SBR No. 8 Mine Area. TVA will consider divestiture of the property in a separate ROD, likely later in 2025, through subsequent consideration and action by the TVA Board of Directors.",

AD 2016-14-03 requires reinforcing the forward pressure bulkhead at a certain stringer on both the left- hand and right-hand sides and doing related investigative and corrective actions if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2016-14-03, new crack findings have prompted the need for repetitive inspections of the area. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2016-14-03, add repetitive inspections of structure at a certain frame and applicable corrective actions, provide a terminating action for the repetitive inspections, and remove airplanes from the applicability, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
