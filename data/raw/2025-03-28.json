      "abstract": "In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is forwarding an Information Collection Request (ICR) to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Our ICR describes the information we seek to collect from the public. Review and approval by OIRA ensures that we impose appropriate paperwork burdens. The RRB invites comments on the proposed collections of information to determine (1) the practical utility of the collections; (2) the accuracy of the estimated burden of the collections; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information that is the subject of collection; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of collections on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Comments to the RRB or OIRA must contain the OMB control number of the ICR. For proper consideration of your comments, it is best if the RRB and OIRA receive them within 30 days of the publication date. Title and purpose of information collection: Medicare; OMB 3220- 0082. Under Section 7(d) of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) (45 U.S.C. 231f), the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) administers the Medicare program for persons covered by the railroad retirement system. The RRB uses Form AA-6, Employee Application for Medicare; Form AA-7, Spouse/ Divorced Spouse Application for Medicare; and Form AA-8, Widow/Widower Application for Medicare; to obtain the information needed to determine whether individuals who have not yet filed for benefits under the RRA are qualified for Medicare payments provided under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Further, to determine if any qualified railroad retirement beneficiary who is claiming supplementary medical insurance coverage under Medicare is entitled to a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) and/or premium surcharge relief because of coverage under an Employer Group Health Plan (EGHP), the RRB needs to obtain information regarding the claimant's EGHP coverage, if any. The RRB uses Form RL- 311-F, Evidence of Coverage Under An Employer Group Health Plan, to obtain the basic information needed to establish EGHP coverage for a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary. The RRB will use new Form AA-23, Application For Medicare--Medical Insurance (Part B) Program, to obtain information from a quailed railroad retirement beneficiary to determine if they are eligible to enroll through the Initial Enrollment Period, Special Enrollment Period, or General Enrollment Period. The RRB will use new Form AA-24, Application for Medicare Part B-- Special Enrollment Period (Exceptional Conditions), to obtain the information needed to determine if a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary is entitled to a SEP because of an exceptional condition. One response is requested of each respondent. Previous Requests for Comments: The RRB has already published the initial 60-day notice (90 8165 on January 24, 2025) required by 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2). That request elicited no comments.",
