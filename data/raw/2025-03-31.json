AD 2018-26-03 also requires a general visual inspection to determine the seat part numbers of the Captain's and First Officer's seats, a cable adjustment check on seats with certain seat part numbers, and applicable on-condition actions. Since the FAA issued AD 2018-26-03, the FAA has determined that additional seats are affected by the unsafe condition. This proposed AD would retain the actions required by AD 2018-26-03 and add an inspection for previously omitted part numbers.
