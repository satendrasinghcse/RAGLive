On August 26, 2024, NHTSA opened Defect Petition DP24- 004 to evaluate the petitioner's request. After consideration of the petition, NHTSA believes that the issues raised here are best addressed through its recent rulemaking and the ongoing actions under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Accordingly, the agency has denied the petition.",
