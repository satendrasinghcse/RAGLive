AD 2010-05-51 required repetitively inspecting the main rotor (M/R) head rotor hub (rotor hub) and, depending on the results, taking corrective action. Since the FAA issued those ADs, the manufacturer revised the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) to incorporate various airworthiness limitations, tasks, and associated thresholds and intervals that were previously contained in service bulletins, as well as incorporate a new task. This AD requires revising the ALS of the existing maintenance manual (MM) or instructions for continued airworthiness (ICAs) and the existing approved maintenance or inspection program, as applicable, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference.

Since the FAA issued AD 2023-22-11, the FAA has determined that the applicability should be expanded to include all Model EMB-505 airplanes and, for certain airplanes, an additional requirement is necessary for the initial replacement of the retaining bolt and washer. This proposed AD would also provide an optional terminating action for the repetitive retaining bolt and washer replacement. These actions are specified in an Ag[ecirc]ncia Nacional de Avia[ccedil][atilde]o Civil (ANAC) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference.
