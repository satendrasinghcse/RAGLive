The FM allotments were previously removed from the FM Table because a construction permit and/or license was granted. These FM allotments are now considered vacant because of the cancellation of the associated FM authorizations or the dismissal of long-form auction FM applications. A staff engineering analysis confirms that all of the vacant FM allotments complies with the minimum distance separation requirements and principle community coverage requirements of the Commission's rules. The window period for filing applications for these vacant FM allotments will not be opened at this time. Instead, the issue of opening these allotments for filing will be addressed by the Commission in subsequent order.",

This PR Notice supersedes PR Notice 98-5, entitled \"New forms for the Certification with Respect to Citation of Data\" dated June 12, 1998. The revised procedures eliminate the requirement to submit two paper versions of the completed data matrix form and establishes electronic online submissions.

This AD was prompted by a report of deviations during the manufacturing process that caused incorrect application of a certain thread-locker to certain sprag clutch housing and oil spray nozzles. This AD requires repetitive operational checks of the battery backup function with removal of the engine from service if insufficient battery power is found, one-time inspections of the oil spray nozzle and generator stator assembly, and, depending on the results of the inspections, replacement with parts eligible for installation. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

This AD was prompted by a manufacturer assessment that determined additional actions are necessary to improve particle detection for main gearboxes (MGBs) with certain planet gear bearings installed. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the MGB bevel wheel and the MGB magnetic plug for particles and prohibits installing an affected MGB unless certain requirements are met. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
