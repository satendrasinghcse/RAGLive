The EPA is proposing to find these 2017, 2026, and 2035 MVEBs for PM<INF>2.5</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> adequate and to approve these MVEBs into the Pennsylvania SIP for transportation conformity purposes. This action does not redesignate the Allegheny County Area to attainment for the 2012 annual PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS, as Pennsylvania withdrew its redesignation request specific to the Allegheny County Area. The redesignation request and maintenance plan were submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP or Pennsylvania) on behalf of the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD).

      "abstract": "This regulation establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of choline chloride (CASRN 67-48-1) when used as an inert ingredient (adjuvant) applied to or on animals. Stratacor, Inc. on behalf of Emery Olochemicals LLC, submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.
