AD 2021-09-06 required repetitive inspections for cracking of the left- and right-hand outboard chords of certain frame fittings and failsafe straps at a certain station around eight fasteners, and repair if any cracking is found. This AD was prompted by additional reports of cracking in the area and a subsequent determination that additional inspections are needed to address the unsafe condition. This AD requires repetitive detailed and ultrasonic inspections for cracking of the left- and right-hand sides of certain frame fittings and failsafe straps, and repair if any cracking is found. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
