      "abstract": "This document amends the Table of TV Allotments (table) of the Federal Communications Commission's (Commission) rules by substituting channel *29 for channel *13 at Monroe, Louisiana in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by Louisiana Educational Television Authority (LETA), the licensee of noncommercial educational television PBS member station KLTM-TV, channel *13, Monroe, Louisiana. The staff engineering analysis finds that the proposal is in compliance with the Commission's principal community coverage and technical requirements. The substitution of channel *29 for channel *13 in the table will not result in any loss of existing service and it will also allow LETA to remedy its known viewer reception issues on its currently authorized VHF channel.",

      "abstract": "The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board received 212 pages of records from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) related to a civil rights cold case incident to which the Review Board assigned the unique identifier 2023-001-002. NARA did not propose any postponements of disclosure. The Department of Justice and the FBI proposed 471 postponements of disclosure. The Department of Justice later withdrew two postponements it proposed. On March 28, 2025, the Review Board met and approved 186 postponements, requested changes to 26 postponements, and determined that 168 pages in full and 44 pages in part should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with section 7(c)(4) of the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.",

Title and purpose of information collection: Application for Benefits Due But Unpaid at Death; OMB 3220-0055. Under Section 2(g) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (45 U.S.C. 352), benefits that accrued but were not paid because of the death of the employee shall be paid to the same individual(s) to whom benefits are payable under section 6(a)(1) of the Railroad Retirement Act. The provisions relating to the payment of such benefits are prescribed in 20 CFR 325.5 and 20 CFR 335.5. The RRB provides Form UI-63, Application for Benefits Due But Unpaid at Death, to those applying for the accrued sickness or unemployment benefits unpaid at the death of the employee and for obtaining the information needed to identify the proper payee. One response is requested of each respondent. Completion is required to obtain a benefit. The RRB proposes the following changes to Form UI-63:",

The FAA previously sent this AD as an emergency AD to all known U.S. owners and operators of these helicopters. This AD was prompted by deformation and/or improper pin engagement in the knuckles of the door hinge on the aft movable ballast box assembly. This AD requires removing all ballast weights from the aft movable ballast box assembly and prohibits the use of ballast weights within the aft movable ballast box assembly, as specified in a Transport Canada emergency AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
