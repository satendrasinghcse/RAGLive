      "abstract": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing, largely as proposed, a narrow modification to its 2022 Construction General Permit (CGP) to expand the list of areas eligible for coverage to include construction projects in all Lands of Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction. This modification is necessary because the EPA is the permitting authority in Lands of Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction, and when the CGP was issued on February 17, 2022, the permit did not specifically provide eligibility for these areas as a class. The modification also clarifies the CGP requirements that apply to projects that discharge to receiving waters within Lands of Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction in response to the Supreme Court's recent decision in City and County of San Francisco v. EPA. The permit modification and accompanying permit fact sheet can be found at https://www.epa.gov/ npdes/2022-construction-general-permit-cgp.",

This will support the return to service of the steam generators as part of the potential resumption of power operations at the Palisades facility.

This proposed AD was prompted by an engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS) STAB TRIM Caution message that was posted, and subsequent repair that found prematurely worn teeth on a rubber bull gear (RBG) wheel in the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator (HSTA). This proposed AD would require an inspection for part numbers and on-condition replacement of affected RBG wheels and prohibit the installation of affected parts under certain conditions, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

AD 2023-23-12 requires replacing certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) rotor stage 1 disks and a certain compressor rotor stages 6-10 spool. Since the FAA issued AD 2023-23-12, the manufacturer has identified additional parts that were manufactured from material suspected to have reduced material properties due to iron inclusion, which prompted this proposed AD. This proposed AD would retain the requirements to replace certain HPT rotor stage 1 disks and a certain compressor rotor stages 6-10 spool. This proposed AD would also expand the applicability to include additional affected HPT rotor stage 1 disks that were manufactured from the same material suspected to have reduced material properties due to iron inclusion. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
