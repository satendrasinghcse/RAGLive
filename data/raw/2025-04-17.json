The source-specific limitation reflects the technological differences between the facility's new control unit and cold cleaner requirements currently established in Ohio's SIP. Ohio EPA has determined that the source-specific VOC limitation for the cold cleaner is more stringent than existing cold cleaner limits in the Ohio SIP.

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires us to conduct a review of listed species at least once every 5 years to determine whether a species should be removed from the list (i.e., delisted), reclassified from an endangered species to a threatened species (i.e., downlisted), or reclassified from a threatened species to an endangered species (i.e., uplisted). The determination must be based on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of the review. Therefore, we request relevant data (e.g., biology, threats, and conservation efforts) that have become available since the previous reviews of these species.",

In 2016, EOIR issued a final rule amending the regulations governing the requirements and procedures for the recognition of organizations and the accreditation of those organizations' representatives to represent persons in proceedings before EOIR and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Those regulatory amendments transferred the administration of the Recognition and Accreditation (R&A) Program within EOIR from the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) to the Office of Legal Access Programs (OLAP). In 2019, the R&A Program was transferred by regulation to the Office of Policy (OP), the part of EOIR that oversees OLAP. EOIR proposes to modify JUSTICE/BIA-002 and to change the system number to JUSTICE/EOIR-004 to reflect the transfer of the R&A Program to OP. The last publication of the complete system of records notice was in 1980, prior to the issuance of OMB A-108. As such, EOIR is re-publishing the System of Records Notice for this system, in full. Additionally, the agency's Access EOIR initiative gave rise to the modernization of the Recognition and Accreditation Program application process through the development of the Recognition and Accreditation Access (RAA) system allowing prospective applicants to apply online for recognition or accreditation and online account management of an approved organization. Modified JUSTICE/EOIR-004 captures this modernization effort.",

      "abstract": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 9 is proposing to reissue a NPDES general permit authorizing discharges of treated effluent from bulk fuel storage facilities located in Guam (Permit No. GUG000001). EPA proposes to reissue the permit upon completion of the notice and comment period and after consideration of all comments received. Upon issuance, the permit will be valid for five years. Use of a NPDES general permit allows EPA and dischargers to allocate resources in a more efficient manner while ensuring consistent permit conditions for comparable facilities. This notice announces the availability of the proposed NPDES general permit and the corresponding fact sheet for public comment, both of which can be found on EPA Region 9's website: https://www.epa.gov/npdes-permits/npdes-permits-epas- pacific-southwest-region-9. EPA is also taking comments on the frequency, duration, and volume of water discharges from each bulk fuel facility for the years including 2019 to 2024.",

DOE is initiating this effort through this request for information to ensure consistency with recently issued Executive Orders, while continuing to satisfy the Department's statutory obligations in the development of appliance and equipment standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). Subsequently, DOE expects to expeditiously publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that proposes potential changes to the Process Rule and that will also provide feedback on the public comment received in response to this document and seek additional information on other potential improvements.",
