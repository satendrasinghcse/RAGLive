Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed information collection is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the RRB's estimate of the burden of the collection of the information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden related to the collection of information on respondents, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. 1. Title and purpose of information collection: Employer's Quarterly Report of Contributions under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act; OMB 3220-0012. Under Section 8 of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) (45 U.S.C. 358), the RRB determines the amount of an employer's contribution, primarily on the basis of the RUIA benefits paid, both unemployment and sickness, to the employees of the railroad employer. These experienced-based contributions take into account the frequency, volume, and duration of the employees' unemployment and sickness benefits. Each employer's contribution rate includes a component for administrative expenses as well as a component to cover costs shared by all employers. The regulations prescribing the manner and conditions for remitting the contributions and for adjusting overpayments or underpayments of contributions are contained in 20 CFR 345. RRB Form DC-1, Employer's Quarterly Report of Contributions under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, is used by railroad employers to report and remit their quarterly contributions to the RRB. Employers can use either the manual version of the form or its internet equivalent. One response is requested quarterly of each respondent and completion is mandatory. The RRB proposes the following changes to the manual and electronic versions of Form DC-1: <bullet> Top of page: Changed \"Employer Number\" to \"Employer BA Number\". <bullet> Top of page: Changed \"Calendar Year and Quarter\" to \"Reporting Period (Calendar Year and Quarter)\". <bullet> Field 1: Changed \"Current Reporting Period\" to \"Reporting Period Compensation\". <bullet> Field 2: Changed \"Compensation Adjustments reported on Form BA-4\" to \"Compensation Adjustments--Prior Year Compensation Adjustments Reported on Form(s) BA-4 in the Reporting Period\". <bullet> Field 3: Changed \"Total\" to \"Total Reporting Period Compensation\". <bullet> Field 4: Changed \"Total\" to \"Total Compensation and Corrections\". <bullet> Form instruction: Updated the Paperwork Reduction Act section and instructions to match field name changes to the form.",

AD 2024-06-02 was prompted by a report of a crack on the centrifugal compressor case mount pad weld area caused by a non- conforming weld (lack of welding penetration). AD 2024-06-02 requires a one-time detailed visual inspection (DVI) of the compressor case pad welds for any crack, and replacement of the compressor case if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-06-02, the manufacturer determined that the compliance time for the DVI can be extended, and repetitive inspections of the centrifugal compressor case must be accomplished. This proposed AD would require performing repetitive DVIs of the compressor case pad welds for any crack, replacing the compressor case if necessary, and sending certain inspection results to the manufacturer, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

      "abstract": "The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing a rule to increase career employee accountability. Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct. The proposed rule lets policy-influencing positions be moved into Schedule Policy/Career. These positions will remain career jobs filled on a nonpartisan basis. Yet they will be at-will positions excepted from adverse action procedures or appeals. This will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or undermine the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.",
