The initial IHA authorized take of 10 species of marine mammals, by Level A and Level B harassment, incidental to construction associated with the Navy's Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest (NAVFAC) Northwest Marine Structure Program (MPR) project in Puget Sound, Washington. The project has been delayed and none of the work covered in the initial IHA has been conducted. The scope of the activities and anticipated effects remain the same, authorized take numbers are not changed, and the required mitigation, monitoring, and reporting remains the same as included in the initial IHA. NMFS is, therefore, issuing a second identical IHA to cover the incidental take analyzed and authorized in the initial IHA.",

This proposed AD was prompted by a review of design data and the determination for recalculation of accumulated hoist boom cycles (cycles) and repetitive inspections. This proposed AD would require determining the total cycles of certain hoist boom assemblies, inspecting those hoist boom assemblies, and depending on the results, taking corrective action. This proposed AD would also prohibit installing those hoist boom assemblies unless certain requirements are met. These actions are specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference.
