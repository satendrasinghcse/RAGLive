The Defense Health Agency (DHA) has awarded contracts to CareSource Military & Veterans (CSMV) in both the Atlanta, Georgia market and the Tampa, Florida market and intends to evaluate the impact of having two MCSCs (the Competitive Plans Demonstration (CPD) contractors and Humana Government Business (HGB), the current East region MCSC) providing services in these markets. Eligible beneficiaries will be provided with the opportunity to enroll in TRICARE Prime with CSMV in these markets. This demonstration will also help the DHA assess the efficacy of paying a TRICARE MCSC using a risk-adjusted, population-based capitation methodology for non-pharmacy health care and variable ongoing administrative costs and the efficacy of separately contracting for certain health care administrative tasks (e.g., eligibility, enrollment, and encounter data management functions) rather than including such requirements in the MCS contract.",

The proposal would increase the base charge 7.9 percent, from $74.3 million in FY 2025 to $80.2 million in FY 2026. The change is due primarily to an increase in the Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses and a decrease in anticipated prior year carryover funds from FY 2025. The proposed base charge and rates would go into effect on October 1, 2025, and remain in effect through September 30, 2026. Publication of this Federal Register notice will initiate the public process.",

Mr. Farley sought an exemption from the requirement that instructors have at least two years of driving experience of the same or higher class and/or the same endorsement level as the commercial motor vehicle (CMV) to be operated. This exemption would have allowed Mr. Farley to serve as an ELDT instructor for students seeking Class A CDLs without having the required two years of experience driving Class A CDLs. FMCSA analyzed the application and public comments and determined that granting the exemption would not likely achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to, or greater than, the level that would be achieved absent such exemption.",

      "abstract": "The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2021-24- 09, which applied to certain Bell Textron Canada Limited Model 430 helicopters. AD 2021-24-09 required a visual inspection of the main rotor (M/R) pitch link clevis (clevis), rod end, and a certain part- numbered universal bearing, performing a purge grease, and performing a magnetic particle inspection of each M/R clevis, and depending on the inspection results, removing or replacing certain parts and performing additional actions. AD 2021-24-09 also required recurring inspections of each M/R clevis and each universal bearing. Since the FAA issued AD 2021-24-09, the manufacturer has reduced the life limits of the affected parts and introduced new M/R pitch link assemblies by re- identifying the M/R pitch link assemblies that were required to be inspected by AD 2021-24-09. This AD requires similar actions as AD 2021-24-09 but reduces the life limits and requires replacing the M/R pitch link assemblies with re-identified part numbered assemblies. These actions are specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
