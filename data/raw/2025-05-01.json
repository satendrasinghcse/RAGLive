This AD was prompted by cracks being found during full-scale fatigue testing of the keel beam bottom panel between the edge profile and stringer run-out at a certain frame and stringer. This AD requires repetitive special detailed inspections (SDI) of the affected area, and corrective actions, if necessary, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is incorporated by reference. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",
