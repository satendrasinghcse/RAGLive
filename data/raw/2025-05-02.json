The purpose of these regulations since their first adoption more than 50 years ago has been to strike the proper balance between the public's interest in the free dissemination of ideas and information and the public's interest in effective law enforcement and the fair administration of justice. But after several years under these changes, the Department has concluded that the current policy strikes the wrong balance, undermining the Department's ability to safeguard classified, privileged, and other sensitive information, and that the earlier, longstanding practices related to news media records were more optimal. The rule therefore rescinds the amendments of 2022 and adopts a modified version of the 2014 regulations, revised to better align with what had been longstanding Department practice.",

      "abstract": "The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing to remove the prohibition of a forced distribution of performance rating levels within the Senior Executive Service (SES) as well as eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) language within SES performance management regulations. Currently, agencies are prohibited from establishing quotas or limits on the number or proportion of the various rating levels assigned, meaning that each senior executive potentially can receive any rating based on their performance, irrespective of how other senior executives perform within the agency. However, governmentwide SES ratings data have consistently shown that virtually all SES receive the highest rating levels (i.e., levels 4 and 5) despite documented reports of SES failings. Removing the prohibition on forced distribution would allow agencies to establish and enforce limits on the highest SES rating levels, thereby increasing rigor in the SES appraisal process and leading to a more normalized distribution of SES ratings across the Federal Government.",
