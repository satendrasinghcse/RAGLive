These airplanes, as modified by Archeion Holdings LLC (Archeion), will have a novel or unusual design feature when compared to the state of technology envisioned in the airworthiness standards for transport-category airplanes. This design feature is a digital systems architecture that will allow increased connectivity to and access from external network sources, (e.g., operator networks, wireless devices, internet connectivity, service provider satellite communications, electronic flight bags, etc.) to the airplane's previously isolated electronic assets (networks, systems, and databases). The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.",

      "abstract": "On January 21, 2025, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) issued an order in Committee Overseeing Action for Lumber International Trade Investigations or Negotiations, et al., v. United States, et al., Consol. Ct. No. 19-00122 (Slip Op. 25-8) (CIT 2025) (COALITION V), partially sustaining the U.S. Department of Commerce's (Commerce) final results of remand redetermination (remand redetermination), concerning the countervailing duty (CVD) order on certain softwood lumber products (softwood lumber) from Canada. In particular, the CIT sustained Commerce's remand redetermination calculating a 0.88 percent de minimis subsidy rate for Fontaine, Inc. and its cross-owned affiliates Gestion Natanis Inc., Les Placements Jean-Paul Fontaine Ltee, and Placements Nicolas Fontaine Inc. (collectively, Fontaine) and determination to exclude subject merchandise produced and exported by Fontaine from the CVD order on softwood lumber from Canada. On March 13, 2025, the CIT issued an order severing Fontaine, Inc., et al., v. United States, et al., Ct. No. 19- 00154, (Fontaine v. US) from COALITION. The CIT further issued its judgment and ordered that Fontaine's enjoined entries be liquidated in accordance with the final court decision. On April 18, 2025, pursuant to CIT Rule 60(b)(6), the Court further ordered that Commerce: (1) publish an amended final results of the CVD expedited review with respect to Fontaine that reflects the calculated 0.00 percent cash deposit rate for Fontaine, and (2) ensure that subject entries enjoined in the action are liquidated in accordance with the final court decision, including all appeals, consistent with the requirements of section 516A(e) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. Accordingly, Commerce is issuing these amended final results of CVD expedited review reflecting the zero percent cash deposit rate determined in Commerce's remand redetermination. Moreover, we are confirming that Commerce will also direct CBP to liquidate entries enjoined in this action of softwood lumber produced and exported by Fontaine, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, on or after April 28, 2017, in accordance with the final court decision in this case, including all appeals.",
