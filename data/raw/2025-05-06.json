      "abstract": "The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board received 857 pages of records from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) related to two civil rights cold case incidents to which the Review Board assigned the unique identifiers 2024-003-041 and 2024-003-042. NARA did not propose any postponements of disclosure. The Department of Justice and the FBI proposed 1,422 postponements of disclosure and later withdrew 97 of those postponements. On April 23, 2025, the Review Board approved 489 postponements and portions of 28 additional postponements, and determined that 648 pages in full and 209 pages in part should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with section 7(c)(4) of the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.",
