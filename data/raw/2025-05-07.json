Specifically, TerraPower, LLC (TerraPower), on behalf of its wholly-owned subsidiary US SFR Owner, LLC (USO), requested an exemption that would modify a portion of the definition of construction applicable to the prohibition on construction of production and utilization facilities without an NRC license for the proposed Kemmerer 1. If granted, this exemption would allow the driving of piles, subsurface preparation, placement of backfill, concrete, or permanent retaining walls within an excavation, installation of foundations, or in-place assembly, erection, fabrication or testing, which are for structures, systems, and components (SSCs) classified as non-safety-related with no special treatment (NST) the failure of which could cause a reactor scram or actuation of a safety-related system that are located on the proposed Kemmerer 1 energy island prior to receipt of a construction permit (CP) and without a limited work authorization. The NRC staff is issuing a final Environmental Assessment (EA) and FONSI associated with the proposed exemption request.",
