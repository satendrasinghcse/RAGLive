The applicant requested this authorization for take by harassment that may result from activities associated with pile driving and marine construction activities in Near Island Channel in Kodiak, Alaska. We estimate that this project may result in the nonlethal incidental take by harassment of up to 460 northern sea otters from the Southwest Alaska stock. This proposed authorization, if finalized, will be for up to 3,160 takes of 460 northern sea otters by Level B harassment. No take by Level A harassment or lethal take are requested, or expected, and no such take will be authorized.",
