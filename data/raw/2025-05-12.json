      "abstract": "The Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board received 425 pages of records from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) related to a civil rights cold case incident to which the Review Board assigned the unique identifier 2024-003-016. NARA did not propose any postponements of disclosure. The Department of Justice and the FBI proposed 423 postponements of disclosure. The FBI later withdrew 32 of those postponements. On May 2, 2025, the Review Board approved 120 postponements and portions of 13 additional postponements, and determined that 399 pages in full and 26 pages in part should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.",
