AD 2017-23-04 requires an inspection of the upper wing skin and top stringer joints, and modification of the stringer joint couplings if necessary. Since the FAA issued AD 2017-23-04, it has been determined that additional airplanes may be subject to the identified unsafe condition. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2017-23-04 and would add airplanes, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). This proposed AD would also remove certain airplanes from the applicability. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

As promulgated in October 2023, the regulation requires manufacturers (including importers) of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in any year between 2011-2022 to report certain data to EPA related to exposure and environmental and health effects. This change is necessary because EPA requires more time to prepare the reporting application to collect this data. The Agency is separately considering reopening certain aspects of the rule to public comment. The delayed reporting date ensures that EPA has adequate time to consider the public comments and propose and finalize any modifications to the rule before the submission period begins.",
