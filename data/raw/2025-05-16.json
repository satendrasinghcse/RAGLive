These lands comprise approximately 1,150 acres at Kahuku Training Area (KTA), approximately 4,390 acres at Kawailoa-Poamoho Training Area (Poamoho), and approximately 782 acres at Makua Military Reservation (MMR).

Because the proposed retention involves State-owned lands, the EIS is a joint NEPA-HEPA document that meets requirements of both statutes. The Army will observe a 30-day waiting period before deciding how much land, if any, it will seek to retain.",

Because all interested parties timely withdrew their requests for administrative review for certain companies, we are rescinding this administrative review, in part, with respect to those companies. In addition, we are also rescinding this administrative review with respect to certain other companies because they had no reviewable entries of subject merchandise during the POR. For a list of the companies for which we are rescinding this review based on timely withdrawals of requests for review, see Appendix I to this notice. For a list of the companies for which we are rescinding this review in the absence of suspended entries of subject merchandise during the POR, see Appendix II to this notice.

The two settlement agreements concern the Mohawk Tannery Site in Nashua, New Hampshire. The Blaylock Modified PPA and the Greenfield PPA are entered into pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (\"CERCLA,\" also known as the Superfund law), and the authority of the Attorney General of the United States to compromise and settle claims of the United States. The proposed Blaylock Modified BFPPA is between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and bona fide prospective purchaser Blaylock Holdings, LLC. The proposed Blaylock Modified BFPPA requires that Blaylock conduct work under EPA oversight in exchange for a covenant not to sue pursuant to sections 106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607(a) for existing contamination at the Mohawk Tannery Site. The Blaylock Modified BFPPA provides pre- authorized mixed funding for the work. Under the Greenfield PPA, Greenfield has an agreement to assume long-term ownership duties and to perform post-removal site controls in connection with approximately 4 acres of property (the \"Containment Parcel\") located in Nashua, New Hampshire, which is a part of the Mohawk Tannery Site as set forth in the Blaylock Modified BFPPA, EPA Region 1 CERCLA Docket No. 01-2024- 0056 pertaining to the Site and the Containment Parcel, which is a portion of the Site. Blaylock and Greenfield consent to and will not contest the authority of the United States to enter into the Blaylock Modified BFPPA and the Greenfield PPA, or to implement or enforce their respective terms. Blaylock and Greenfield recognize that these settlement agreements have been negotiated in good faith and that the Blaylock Modified BFPPA and Greenfield PPA are entered into without the admission or adjudication of any issue of fact or law.",

Before a Federal agency can collect certain information from the public, it must receive approval from OMB. Under procedures established by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, before seeking OMB approval, Federal agencies must solicit public comment on proposed collections of information, including extensions and reinstatement of previously approved collections. This document describes a collection of information for which NHTSA intends to seek a revision to an OMB-approved collection titled \"Drivers' Use of Camera-Based Rear Visibility Systems Versus Traditional Mirrors\" identified by OMB Control Number 2127-0756. The collection is currently approved through July 31, 2025, and supports research addressing safety-related aspects of drivers' use of camera-based rear visibility systems designed to replace or supplement vehicle rearview mirrors. This collection is necessary to inform next steps on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) NHTSA published in response to two petitions requesting revision of FMVSS No. 111 to permit such camera- based systems as an alternative compliance option for certain current requirements specifying rearview mirrors. This revision includes changes in respondents and thus a change in burden hours and requests an extension to continue data collection.",

The fishery management measures include fishing areas, seasons, quotas, legal gear, recreational fishing days and catch limits, harvest guidelines, possession and landing restrictions, and minimum lengths for salmon taken in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off Washington, Oregon, and California. These measures are intended to prevent overfishing while achieving, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from the fishery, to provide for the exercise of federally recognized fishing rights by West Coast Indian Tribes, to allow a portion of the salmon runs to escape the ocean fisheries in order to provide for spawning escapement, and to apportion the ocean harvest equitably among non-Indian commercial and recreational fisheries.",
