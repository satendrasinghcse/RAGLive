PDUFA authorizes FDA to collect user fees to support the process for the review of human drug applications. The current legislative authority for PDUFA expires in September 2027. At that time, new legislation will be required for FDA to continue collecting prescription drug user fees in future fiscal years. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) directs that FDA begin the PDUFA reauthorization process by publishing a notice in the Federal Register requesting public input and holding a public meeting where the public may present its views on the reauthorization. FDA invites public comment as the Agency begins the process to reauthorize the program in FYs 2028 through 2032. These comments will be published and available on FDA's website.",
