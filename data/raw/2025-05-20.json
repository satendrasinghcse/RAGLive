The exemption renewal allows DECS members that employ commercial driver's license (CDL) holders to conduct a limited query of the Clearinghouse before hiring a driver for a project. If the limited query indicates that information about the driver exists in the Clearinghouse, the driver is not permitted to perform safety-sensitive functions unless and until a full query subsequently shows that the driver is not prohibited from operating a commercial motor vehicle (CMV). FMCSA has analyzed the exemption application and the public comments and has determined that the exemption, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below, is likely to achieve a level of safety that is equivalent to or greater than the level that would be achieved in the absence of the exemption.",

Relatedly, EPA is also adjusting the default unit-level allocations of emission allowances to Indiana EGUs for 2024 and subsequent years in accordance with the adjustments to the state emissions budget. When originally establishing state emissions budgets and default unit-level allocations for 2024 and subsequent years in the Revised CSAPR Update rulemaking, EPA relied in part on announcements from EGU owners regarding their plans to retire certain EGUs before the 2024 ozone season. The purpose of the adjustments being made in this action is to account for the subsequent decisions by some EGU owners to defer or cancel the previously announced retirement plans.",
