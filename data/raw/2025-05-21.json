This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the Fish Lake Valley tui chub. After a review of the best scientific and commercial data available, we find that listing the Fish Lake Valley tui chub is warranted. If adopted as proposed, this rule would extend the Act's protections to the Fish Lake Valley tui chub.",
