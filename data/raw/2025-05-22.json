Since the FAA issued AD 2019-19-13, an additional part-numbered MGB has been identified to have the same unsafe condition and the FAA determined that additional changes are necessary. This proposed AD would require the actions of AD 2019-19-13 and, expand the applicability by adding the additional part-numbered MGB, change the requirement to determine the total hours TIS of a certain free wheel shaft, require repetitive replacement of the MGB or the RH free wheel shaft, change the requirements for who can replace parts, and expand the parts installation limitation conditions.
