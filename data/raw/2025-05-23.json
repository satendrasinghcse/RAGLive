      "abstract": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve into the Oregon State Implementation Plan (SIP) the Lane Regional Air Protection Agency (LRAPA) revised outdoor burning rule revisions submitted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) on July 1, 2024, in coordination with LRAPA. The revised rule, applicable in Lane County, Oregon, clarifies terminology, revises formatting, and expands the residential outdoor burning season to allow burning of woody yard trimmings on approved burn days within Lowell city limits from October 1 through June 15. ODEQ included in the submittal a technical demonstration that the requested expansion of the residential outdoor burning season will not interfere with attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS and other applicable Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements. The EPA is proposing to approve this rule because it meets the applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.",

The collection involves information submitted on FAA form 8710-13 (Remote Pilot Certificate and/or Rating Application) by persons applying for a Part 107 remote pilot certificate and/or rating. A Part 107 remote pilot certificate and/or rating is required to act as remote pilot in command of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) being operated under Part 107. The form requires an applicant to provide information such as their name, address, physical characteristics (height, weight, etc.), existing pilot certificates, and whether the applicant took the knowledge test or training course. The applicant must provide proof of completion of a knowledge test or training course, as applicable, with the application. The information to be collected will be used to identify and evaluate your qualifications and eligibility for the issuance of a remote pilot certificate and/or rating. Form 8710-13 can be submitted electronically using the FAA's online Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA), by mail, or in person at certain FAA facilities.",

This final rule maintains and extends management measures for fishing vessels targeting tropical tuna (i.e., bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), and skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis)) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). The fishing restrictions will apply to large purse seine vessels of class sizes 4-6 (i.e., vessels with a carrying capacity of 182 metric tons (mt) or greater) and longline vessels greater than 24 meters in overall length that fish for tropical tuna in the EPO. This rule is necessary for the conservation of tropical tuna stocks in the EPO and for the United States to satisfy its obligations as a member of the IATTC.",
