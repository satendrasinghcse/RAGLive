This proposed change is being made to be consistent with the methodology used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) consistent with CHGME Payment Program's long-standing practice of using the same methodology in calculating FTE counts as CMS does in Medicare GME and to minimize administrative burden on hospital who participate in both programs.

Specifically, EPA is proposing to extend by 18 months the Workplace Chemical Protection Program (WCPP) and the associated recordkeeping compliance dates for laboratories that are not owned or operated by agencies or Federal contractors acting on behalf of the Federal government. Under this proposal, all laboratories, whether federal or not, would have the same compliance dates, which would be aligned with current compliance dates for Federal agencies and Federal contractors. EPA is proposing to extend the compliance dates for associated laboratory activities detailed in this proposal to avoid disruption of important functions such as the use of environmental monitoring methods needed for cleanup sites and wastewater treatment, as well as activities associated with university laboratories. The use of environmental monitoring methods, a common function of non-federal laboratories, is important to EPA's mission to ensure that the air is safe to breathe, water is safe for drinking or recreating, and disposal activities protect the environment.",

On May 9, 2025 and May 16, 2025, the Review Board met and approved 161 postponements and portions of 33 additional postponements, and determined that 354 pages in full and 64 pages in part should be publicly disclosed in the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection. By issuing this notice, the Review Board complies with the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018 that requires the Review Board to publish in the Federal Register its determinations on the disclosure or postponement of records in the Collection no more than 14 days after the date of its decision.",

This AD was prompted by reports of lost synchronization between radio management panels (RMPs). This AD requires revising the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) by providing instructions to address dual loss of RMP data synchronization. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

In total, approximately 760,071 acres (307,590 hectares) in California fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. Comments previously submitted on the proposed rule need not be resubmitted as they are already incorporated into the public record for the rulemaking action and will be fully considered in our development of the final rule.",
