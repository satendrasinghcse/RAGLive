This rule specifies the administrative provisions, eligibility requirements, and payment calculation for ELRP 2023 and 2024. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) will calculate payments using data already submitted to FSA by Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) participants; therefore, producers are not required to file an additional application to receive ELRP 2023 and 2024 payments.",

Recent taxonomic studies have indicated that the currently listed entity is actually two species: Sclerocactus glaucus and Sclerocactus dawsoniae (previously identified as S. dawsonii in the proposed rule). When we use the common name \"Colorado hookless cactus\" or refer to \"the species\" in this final rule, we are referring to information or conclusions regarding both species (S. glaucus and S. dawsoniae) as the currently listed entity. When we are referring to information or analysis pertaining to one species, we will use the new scientific names of S. glaucus or S. dawsoniae. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that delisting Colorado hookless cactus is warranted. Our review indicates that the threats to the Colorado hookless cactus have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species no longer meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Accordingly, the prohibitions and conservation measures provided by the Act, particularly through sections 4 and 7, will no longer apply to the Colorado hookless cactus.",

AMS conducted a referendum among eligible producers to determine whether they favor establishing a national promotion, research, and information program (Program).
