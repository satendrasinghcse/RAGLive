AD 2013-08-08 also provides optional terminating action for the repetitive inspections. Since the FAA issued AD 2013-08-08, Boeing has reported that the compliance times are not adequate because new fleet data indicates that crack growth is faster and more distributed between tear straps, resulting in longer cracks than originally observed in the test data that prompted AD 2013-08-08. This proposed AD would continue to require the actions in AD 2013-08- 08, at reduced initial compliance times and repetitive intervals for the inspections, and mandate post-modification inspections if the optional modification is accomplished. The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

The U.S. exports will enable the copper-gold mining project in Pakistan to establish a projected average production capacity of c.800 kdmt per annum of copper concentrate, leading to an expected output of c.220 kt of copper and c.310 koz of gold per year for Phase 1 of the project during the first ten years (100% basis, excluding 2028 ramp-up year).

Additionally, this draft guidance recommends that new drug application (NDA) and abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) holders submit information to support color additive replacements in changes being effected in 30 days (CBE-30) supplements. Although a qualitative or quantitative change to an inactive ingredient is generally considered a major change, in many cases, replacing a color additive with one that is listed in the color additive regulations is unlikely to adversely affect the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product.

The retrofitting requirements were adopted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on March 31, 1999, and require that motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce install retroreflective tape or reflex reflectors on the sides and rear of semitrailers and trailers that were manufactured prior to December 1, 1993, have an overall width of 2,032 mm (80 inches) or more, and a gross vehicle weight rating of 4,536 kg (10,001 pounds) or more. With the passage of more than 30 years since the NHTSA requirements were implemented, FMCSA believes the vast majority of trailers currently in use on the Nation's highways were manufactured after 1993 so the retrofitting rule is no longer necessary.

The certification label or marking provides motor carriers purchasing new trailers or new impact guards to replace damaged devices with a means to determine whether the equipment is certified as meeting the FMVSS. However, the labeling or marking requirement has proven problematic for motor carriers when the label or marking becomes illegible or wears off during the service life of the trailer or guard. This proposal would eliminate an unintended regulatory burden on motor carriers without compromising safety, as this NPRM would not affect the applicable FMVSS.

FDA bases this order on a finding that Mr. Field was convicted of one felony count under Federal law. The factual basis supporting Mr. Field's conviction, as described below, is conduct relating to the importation into the United States of a drug or controlled substance. Mr. Field was given notice of the proposed debarment and was given an opportunity to request a hearing to show why he should not be debarred. As of April 25, 2024 (30 days after receipt of the notice), Mr. Field had not responded. Mr. Field's failure to respond and request a hearing constitutes a waiver of his right to a hearing concerning this matter.",

Peach Bottom is located primarily in Peach Bottom Township, York County, Pennsylvania, near Delta, Pennsylvania. Possible alternatives to the proposed action of SLR include the no-action alternative and reasonable replacement power alternatives.
